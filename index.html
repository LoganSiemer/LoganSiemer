                    <h3 class="header">What i do during the morning time</h3>
                    <p class="header">In the morning I get all my morning chores done, that involves feeding, watering and, walking my dog, feeding and watering the pigs, and occasionally either fixing or cleaning their living space. After that's done I get ready for the day. Now that's only the morning, during the rest of the day I get my school done, areas cleaned and walking the dogs every now and then. During the night, I feed water and walk my dog, clean areas before bed, and then, get ready for bed</p>

                    <h3 class="header">What type of volunteering, I do</h3>
                    <p class="header">Whenever people ask for help, we tend to go and help them out. For instance, after hurricane Harvey hit people were buying food, water, and supplies to help the victims of hurricane Harvey, but the problem was that there were not many people actually taking their things to Houston, they took their stuff to an airport, where plains picked up the cargo and brought it to Houston, in doing that the people packing got clogged with supplies so we went over and helped out, as well as many other people who brought stuff. </p>
